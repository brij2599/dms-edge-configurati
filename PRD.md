# DMS Visual Workflow Builder - Product Requirements Document

Build a visual workflow builder interface similar to n8n for configuring ETL processes in the DMS platform, allowing users to drag and drop data sources and create visual pipelines.

**Experience Qualities**:
1. **Intuitive** - Users should be able to understand and create workflows without extensive training
2. **Responsive** - Real-time feedback during drag operations and node connections
3. **Professional** - Clean, enterprise-grade interface that instills confidence

**Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality, accounts)
- Requires sophisticated state management for workflow nodes, connections, and real-time updates
- Multiple interconnected features including drag-and-drop, visual connections, node configuration

## Essential Features

### Visual Canvas
- **Functionality**: Infinite scrollable canvas where users can place and connect workflow nodes
- **Purpose**: Provides spatial representation of data flow and processing steps
- **Trigger**: User opens workflow editor or creates new ETL configuration
- **Progression**: Load canvas → Display existing nodes → Allow pan/zoom → Enable node placement
- **Success criteria**: Smooth 60fps interactions, nodes remain positioned correctly during canvas operations

### Node Library Panel
- **Functionality**: Sidebar containing draggable data source and processing nodes
- **Purpose**: Provides available components for building workflows
- **Trigger**: Canvas is active and ready for node placement
- **Progression**: Display categorized nodes → User searches/filters → Drag to canvas → Node instantiated
- **Success criteria**: Nodes render immediately when dropped, maintain visual consistency

### Node Connection System
- **Functionality**: Visual connections between nodes showing data flow direction
- **Purpose**: Represents data pipeline relationships and execution order
- **Trigger**: User drags from output port to input port of another node
- **Progression**: Hover over port → Show connection preview → Drag to target → Validate connection → Create visual link
- **Success criteria**: Connections follow bezier curves, update in real-time during node movement

### Node Configuration
- **Functionality**: Property panels for configuring individual node parameters
- **Purpose**: Allows detailed setup of data sources, transformations, and outputs
- **Trigger**: User selects/double-clicks a workflow node
- **Progression**: Node selection → Show configuration panel → User modifies properties → Auto-save changes → Update node status
- **Success criteria**: Changes persist immediately, validation errors display clearly

### Workflow Execution
- **Functionality**: Run workflows and display real-time execution status
- **Purpose**: Test and deploy ETL configurations
- **Trigger**: User clicks execute button on completed workflow
- **Progression**: Validate workflow → Start execution → Show node-by-node progress → Display results/errors → Update completion status
- **Success criteria**: Visual feedback shows execution flow, errors are clearly identified

## Edge Case Handling
- **Invalid Connections**: Prevent incompatible node types from connecting with clear visual feedback
- **Circular Dependencies**: Detect and prevent workflow loops that would cause infinite execution
- **Large Workflows**: Virtual scrolling and performance optimization for workflows with 100+ nodes
- **Network Failures**: Graceful handling of connection issues during workflow execution
- **Unsaved Changes**: Auto-save with clear indication of save status and conflict resolution

## Design Direction
The interface should feel modern and professional like enterprise development tools, with clean lines and purposeful interactions that reduce cognitive load while handling complex data workflows.

## Color Selection
Triadic (three equally spaced colors) - Professional blue-gray base with accent colors for different node types and status indicators.

- **Primary Color**: Deep Blue `oklch(0.4 0.15 240)` - Communicates trust and technical competence
- **Secondary Colors**: Cool Gray `oklch(0.7 0.02 240)` for backgrounds, Warm Orange `oklch(0.65 0.15 40)` for warnings
- **Accent Color**: Vibrant Green `oklch(0.6 0.15 140)` - Success states and primary CTAs
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background `oklch(0.98 0.005 240)`: Dark Gray text `oklch(0.2 0.02 240)` - Ratio 16.2:1 ✓
  - Card `oklch(1 0 0)`: Dark Gray text `oklch(0.2 0.02 240)` - Ratio 18.1:1 ✓
  - Primary `oklch(0.4 0.15 240)`: White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 9.8:1 ✓
  - Accent `oklch(0.6 0.15 140)`: White text `oklch(1 0 0)` - Ratio 4.7:1 ✓

## Font Selection
Clean, highly legible sans-serif that works well at small sizes for node labels and maintains authority for headings.

- **Typographic Hierarchy**:
  - H1 (Page Title): Inter Bold/24px/tight letter spacing
  - H2 (Section Headers): Inter Semibold/18px/normal spacing
  - Body (Node Labels): Inter Medium/14px/normal spacing
  - Caption (Properties): Inter Regular/12px/wide letter spacing

## Animations
Subtle and functional animations that provide immediate feedback without distracting from the core workflow building task.

- **Purposeful Meaning**: Motion reinforces the flow of data through the pipeline and provides clear feedback for user actions
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Node connections animate smoothly, drag operations have responsive feedback, execution status flows visually through the pipeline

## Component Selection
- **Components**: Canvas (custom), Sidebar with collapsible sections, Dialog for node configuration, Toast notifications for status updates, Button variants for different actions
- **Customizations**: Custom drag-and-drop system, SVG-based connection rendering, Virtualized node positioning system
- **States**: Nodes have idle/selected/executing/error/success states with distinct visual treatments
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for consistent industrial/technical feel - Database, Gear, Play, Stop, AlertCircle
- **Spacing**: 4px base unit, 16px component padding, 24px section spacing, 8px between related elements
- **Mobile**: Responsive breakpoints with collapsible sidebar, touch-optimized drag targets, simplified canvas controls for tablets
