# DMS Workflow Builder - Product Requirements Document

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Create an intuitive visual workflow builder for ETL processes that allows users to drag, drop, and connect nodes to build data pipelines.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can successfully create connected workflows with automatic node connections when using the plus button interface.
- **Experience Qualities**: Intuitive, Responsive, Professional

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Complex Application (advanced functionality with state management)
- **Primary User Activity**: Creating and configuring data workflow pipelines

## Thought Process for Feature Selection
- **Core Problem Analysis**: Users need to build ETL workflows visually by connecting various data sources, transformations, and destinations.
- **User Context**: Data engineers and analysts building automated data pipelines.
- **Critical Path**: Add nodes → Connect nodes → Configure nodes → Execute workflow
- **Key Moments**: Node connection automation, configuration panel interaction, workflow execution

## Essential Features

### Visual Node Editor
- Drag and drop nodes from library to canvas
- Auto-connection when adding nodes via plus button
- Double-click to configure nodes
- Visual connection lines between nodes

### Node Library Panel
- Categorized nodes (source, transform, destination)
- Search and filter capabilities
- Right-side panel that appears on demand

### Workflow Management
- Save and load workflows
- Execute workflows
- Real-time status updates

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Professional confidence and technical precision
- **Design Personality**: Clean, modern, technical but approachable
- **Visual Metaphors**: Flow diagrams, technical blueprints
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface that reveals complexity when needed

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Professional monochromatic with accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#4a5fc1) for trust and reliability
- **Secondary Colors**: Light grays for backgrounds
- **Accent Color**: Green (#22c55e) for success states and actions
- **Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and stability, greens indicate success and progress
- **Color Accessibility**: High contrast ratios maintained throughout

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Single font family (Inter) for consistency
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, body text, and UI labels
- **Font Personality**: Clean, technical, highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Optimized for technical content and UI elements
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent sizing and spacing across all components
- **Which fonts**: Inter (Google Fonts)
- **Legibility Check**: Excellent legibility across all sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Canvas is the primary focus, panels are secondary
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to reduce cognitive load
- **Grid System**: Consistent spacing and alignment throughout
- **Responsive Approach**: Fixed layout optimized for desktop workflow editing
- **Content Density**: Balanced information density with clear visual separation

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: shadcn/ui components for consistency
- **Component Customization**: Custom workflow-specific components for nodes and connections
- **Component States**: Clear hover, selected, and error states for all interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Phosphor icons for technical actions and node types
- **Component Hierarchy**: Primary actions (add node) are prominent, secondary actions are subtle

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design with consistent patterns
- **Style Guide Elements**: Color palette, typography scale, spacing system
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent spacing and proportions create harmony
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional technical tool aesthetic

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance maintained throughout the interface

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for complex workflows with many nodes
- **Testing Focus**: Auto-connection functionality and node positioning
- **Critical Questions**: How to handle complex workflow layouts and performance with many nodes

## Current Status
The workflow builder has been implemented with:
- Visual node editor with drag/drop capability
- Node library panel with categorized components
- Auto-connection functionality via plus buttons
- Configuration panels for node settings
- SVG-based connection rendering

## Known Issues
- Auto-connections may not always render immediately after node creation
- Connection lines need proper z-index positioning
- Node positioning could be optimized for better automatic layout

## Next Steps
- Verify auto-connection functionality
- Improve connection line rendering
- Add workflow persistence
- Implement node configuration validation
